%% Do model analyses
% This takes the intermediate file containing electrode-level features,
% calculates AI, and then does models to classify SOZ. This takes a while,
% in large part because it needs to run the subsampling analyses (takes
% 6 hours or so). It generates .mat files in the plot folder containing the
% model results. If this is set to 0, then the remaining parts of the
% function use the existing .mat model result files to generate figures. If
% set to 1, it replaces these .mat files with new ones.
